# ToDo App

A simple and elegant ToDo application built with **React** (frontend) and **Express** (backend), using **MongoDB** for data storage. The app allows users to create, read, update, and delete tasks, with a dark/light mode toggle for better user experience.

---

## Features

-   **Add Tasks**: Add new tasks with a description.
-   **Edit Tasks**: Update the text of existing tasks.
-   **Mark as Complete**: Toggle tasks between completed and pending.
-   **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks you no longer need.
-   **Dark/Light Mode**: Switch between dark and light themes.
-   **Persistent Data**: Tasks are saved in MongoDB and persist across page reloads.

---

## Technologies Used

-   **Frontend**:

    -   React
    -   Vite (for fast development)
    -   Tailwind CSS (for styling)
    -   Framer Motion (for animations)
    -   React Toastify (for notifications)

-   **Backend**:
    -   Express.js
    -   MongoDB (for database)
    -   Mongoose (for MongoDB object modeling)
    -   CORS (for handling cross-origin requests)

---

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher)
-   [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (running locally or via a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas)

---

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/todo-app.git
cd todo-app
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

#### Frontend

Navigate to the root directory of the project and install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

#### Backend

Navigate to the `backend-ToDoApp` folder and install dependencies:

```bash
cd backend-ToDoApp
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up MongoDB

-   Ensure MongoDB is running locally on `mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017`.
-   If using a cloud service, update the `MONGO_URI` in `backend-ToDoApp/server.js` with your connection string.

### 4. Start the Application

#### Option 1: Start Frontend and Backend Separately

-   **Start the Backend**:

    ```bash
    cd backend-ToDoApp
    npm start
    ```

    The backend will run on `http://localhost:3000`.

-   **Start the Frontend**:
    ```bash
    cd ..
    npm run dev
    ```
    The frontend will run on `http://localhost:5174`.

#### Option 2: Start Both with a Single Command

From the root directory, run:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start both the frontend and backend simultaneously using `concurrently`.
